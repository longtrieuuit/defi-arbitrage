Search algorithm for optimal input amount
- Optimizations:
    - estimate lower bound of expousre as  basefeepergas * mean gas * eth price / expected_return_pre_cost
    - to check if arb can be profitable. check if it is profitable for exposure * cost / return_precost
    - run search algorithm for multiple possible arbitrages simultaneously (in parallel)

How can we advantage from private orderflow

    - token_in ---[pools(exchange_rate)]---> token_out
    - return Call instead of callable
    - returns callback + Call
